# App Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The environment in which the application is running. This should be set to
# 'production' on your live server to enable security features like secure
# cookies. For local development, 'development' is appropriate.

# The network port on which the Fastify server will listen for incoming
# connections. Change this if port 3000 is already in use on your system.
VITE_PORT=3000

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Session Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A long, random, and secret string used to sign the session cookie. This
# prevents the cookie from being tampered with. It must be kept private.
# Generate a secure key using:
# node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
VITE_SESSION_SECRET="your-very-secret-and-strong-session-key"

# The total duration of the session in seconds. After this period of
# inactivity, the user will be effectively logged out.
# Default is 3600, which is 1 hour (60 * 60).

# While the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE for public clients
# does not strictly require a client secret for OIDC specification compliance,

# Therefore, please provide a randomly generated string here.
